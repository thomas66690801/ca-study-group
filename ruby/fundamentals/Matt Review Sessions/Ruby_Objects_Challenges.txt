1. You are running a group of record stores. Think about the classes you might use to represent the store. Make a class of store that has some sensible attributes, and that also contains an attribute to store an array of artists. Now make an artist class that can be used to make artist objects and add those objects to that array. You will need an instance method in your store class that can add an artist. Think about your artist class and create useful methods to add a record to this class. This is an open question, so you will need to think carefully about the structure you want to use to represent the data. You might not make a record class - you could use another data type - but you are welcome to do so if you think it is best.
2. Create three classes, continent, country, and city (or extend as you like). Continent class has at minimum two attributes, name (string) and countries, the second which will contain an array of country objects. It will also have an instance method that will add a country object to the array. Similarly, the country class will have a name (string) and cities array, which will contain city objects, and also an instance method to add them.
